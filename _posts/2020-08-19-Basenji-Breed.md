Basenjis are a breed of hunting dog that originated in Africa many years ago. [Some](https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/basenji/) say they were brought as gifts and companions for the Pharaohs of ancient Egypt. Even after its introduction to the west, the breed has remained largely unchanged from its days of hunting in Africa.

These dogs are of medium-small size, have curly tails, and often come with a red and white coloration. In addition, Basenjis have a number of other unique traits: they produce a "yodeling" sound instead of barking, clean themselves like a cat, and are highly averse to moisture and wet weather. 


I have two Basenjis- one named Jericho and the other named Lily. The first picture below is of Lily and the second is of Jericho.
