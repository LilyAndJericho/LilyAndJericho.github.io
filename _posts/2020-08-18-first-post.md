This website is for a class project in BIOS 823: Statistical Programming for Big Data at Duke University. For our first assignment we had to make our own personal website using GitHub pages; I already had a [personal website](https://joekrinke15.github.io/), so I decided to make a new one that features my dogs Lily and Jericho.
